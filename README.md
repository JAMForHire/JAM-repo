# Team 5

For the group site, we first planned everything in Figma. After agreeing on a basic layout, we decided to split the major sections between the people. Simar worked on the first section, the flex box of the second section, and the third section, Ketu worked on the second section grid layout for the team members and the logo, Jonathan worked on the dropdown for the navbar, and Bhavesh worked on the the fourth section and links. 

We first started by just creating all of the necessary HTML components with class names attached to them. From there, we would each individually work on the CSS for our designated work. We would also meet to discuss any pending issues or blockers during this whole process

In the future, one thing we need to do is create branches for each individual. Everytime someone wanted to commit code, people would have many many merge problems, and this led to some errors along the way. By having branches we would be a lot more organized.
